<h2>Constraint <code>PRIMARY KEY</code> II.</h2><p>There can only be one primary key per table, but it can be made up of several columns.</p><p>If the key is made up of more than one column, for example <code>FIRST_NAME</code>, <code>LAST_NAME</code>, <code>BIRTH_DATE</code>:</p><blockquote><pre><code> CREATE TABLE USERS (<br /> FIRST_NAME VARCHAR(25),<br /> LAST_NAME VARCHAR(30),<br /> BIRTH_DATE DATE,<br /> CONSTRAINT Users_PK PRIMARY KEY(FIRST_NAME, LAST_NAME, BIRTH_DATE)<br /> );</code></pre></blockquote><h3>Exercise:</h3><p>The following is a table that stores the information of the <code>MODULES</code> in which the students can be enrolled:</p><blockquote><pre><code>CREATE TABLE MODULES (<br /> CODE INTEGER NOT NULL,<br /> NAME VARCHAR(100),<br /> DEGREE CHAR(3) <br /> );</code></pre></blockquote><p>There are <code>MODULES</code> that, having the same <code>CODE</code>, can be taught in different < code>DEGREE</code>, such as Databases. Therefore, in said table there is no attribute that, by itself, can identify each of the records. In this case, we must identify the primary key as composed of the <code>CODE</code> and <code>DEGREE</code> attributes.</p>
