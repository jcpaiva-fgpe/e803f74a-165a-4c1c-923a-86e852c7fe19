<h2><a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/14/ddl-default.html" target="_blank"><code>DEFAULT</code> values</a>.</ h2><p>Sometimes it is very tedious to always insert the same value in a given column. Imagine that almost all users were born in <code>Spain</code> and we had a <code>COUNTRY</code> column. It would be more comfortable to assign a default value and only write the value of the country for those students who were not born in <code>Spain</code>. That is what the <code>DEFAULT</code> constraint does.</p><p>In our example we are going to add the <code>COUNTRY</code> field to the <code>USERS</code> table. and we will give it the default value <code>"Spain"</code>.</p><blockquote><pre><code>CREATE TABLE USERS (<br /> COUNTRY VARCHAR(20) DEFAULT 'Spain'<br /> );</code></pre></blockquote><p>In the <code>DEFAULT</code> specifications we will be able to add different expressions: constants, SQL functions and variables.</p>< p>If we want to define, as default value, the current date, regardless of the day we are in, we can use the function <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/14/functions-datetime. html#FUNCTIONS-DATETIME-CURRENT" target="_blank"><code>CURRENT_DATE</code></a> as default:</p><blockquote><pre><code>CREATE TABLE USERS (<br /> HIRE_DATE DATE DEFAULT CURRENT_DATE<br />);</code></pre></blockquote><h3>Exercise:</h3><p>As most of the students we enroll have nationality d <code>'Spanish'</code>, we can save writing that nationality for most students who have it, setting it as <code>NATIONALITY</code> by default.</p>
