<h2>Constraint <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/14/ddl-constraints.html#DDL-CONSTRAINTS-CHECK-CONSTRAINTS" target="_blank"><code>CHECK</code ></a>.</h2><p>We will also need to verify that the values ​​entered in a given column are admissible. For this we will use <code>CHECK</code>.</p><p>This restriction checks that a certain condition is met when filling a column. This condition can be built with columns from that same table.</p><p>If in the USERS table we have the <code>CREDIT</code> field and it can only be between 0 and 2000, we would specify it like this:< /p><blockquote><pre><code>CREATE TABLE USERS (<br /> CREDIT INTEGER CHECK (CREDIT BETWEEN 0 AND 2000)<br />);</code></pre></blockquote><p >The same column can have several <code>CHECK</code> associated with it, for this we put several <code>CONSTRAINT</code> followed and separated by commas.</p><h3>Exercise:</h3> <p>We need to make sure that the students' <code>EMAIL</code> contains at least one <code>@</code>, for which we will need to add a <code>CHECK</code> constraint that use the function <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/14/functions-string.html" target="_blank"><code>POSITION</code></a> to find a < code>'@'</code> in the <code>EMAIL</code> column.</p>
