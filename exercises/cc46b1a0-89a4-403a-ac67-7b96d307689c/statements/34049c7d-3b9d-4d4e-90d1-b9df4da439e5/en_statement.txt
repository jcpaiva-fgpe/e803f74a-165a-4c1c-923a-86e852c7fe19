<p>It is possible that, after creating a table, we realize that we have forgotten to add some field or restriction, perhaps some of the restrictions that we added are no longer necessary or perhaps we want to change the name of some of the fields . Is this possible? Now we will see that it is and in almost all cases we will use the command <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/14/sql-altertable.html" target="_blank"><code>ALTER TABLE< /code></a>.</p><h2>Rename tables</h2><p>If we want to change the name of a table we will use the <code>RENAME</code> clause of the <code>ALTER TABLE command </code>.</p><h3>Syntax:</h3><blockquote><pre><code>ALTER TABLE [ IF EXISTS ] TableName<br /> RENAME TO new_name;</code></pre> </blockquote><h3>Example:</h3><p>In a previous exercise we created the <code>USERS</code> table with the following statement:</p><blockquote><pre><code> CREATE TABLE USERS (<br /> FIRST_NAME VARCHAR(25),<br /> LAST_NAME VARCHAR(30)<br />);</code></pre></blockquote><p>To rename the table as < code>STUDENTS</code>, we should execute the following command:</p><blockquote><p><code>ALTER TABLE <strong>USERS</strong> RENAME TO <strong>STUDENTS</strong>;</ code></p></blockquote><h3>Exercise:</h3><p>Imagine that we have created the following Next table:</p><blockquote><pre><code>CREATE TABLE SUBJECTS (<br /> Name VARCHAR(100),<br /> NumHours INTEGER<br />);</code></pre> </blockquote><p>Rename the <code>SUBJECTS</code> table to <code>MODULES</code>.</p>
