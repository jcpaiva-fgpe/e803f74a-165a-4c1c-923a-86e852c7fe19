<p>We have said before. that to drop a table we will use the command <code>DROP TABLE</code>.</p><h3>Syntax:</h3><blockquote><pre><code>DROP TABLE TableName [CASCADE];</code ></pre></blockquote><p>The <code>CASCADE</code> option can be included for cases where one of the columns is a foreign key in another child table, which would prevent its deletion. By placing this option the restrictions where is foreign key will be deleted before and then the table in question will be deleted.</p><h3>Example:</h3><p>Imagine that we have created two related tables, like <code> MATCHES</code> and <code>USERS</code>, with the following statements:</p><blockquote><pre><code>CREATE TABLE MATCHES (<br /> COD_MATCH INTEGER,<br /> MATCH_DATE DATE ,<br /> PRIMARY KEY (COD_MATCH, MATCH_DATE)<br />);</code></pre></blockquote><p></p><blockquote><pre><code>CREATE TABLE USERS ( <br /> COD_MATCH INTEGER,<br /> FIRST_NAME VARCHAR(25),<br /> LAST_NAME VARCHAR(50),<br /> MATCH_DATE DATE,<br /> CONSTRAINT Match_Cod_Date_FK FOREIGN KEY (COD_MATCH, MATCH_DATE)<br / > REFERENCES MATCHES<br />);</code></pre></blockquote><p>If we were to try to drop the table <code>MATCHES</code> with the command</p><blockquote><pre> <code>DROP TABLE MATCHES;</code></pre></blockquote><p>the following error would be returned:</p><blockquote><p><code>ERROR : cannot drop table matches because other objects depend on it</code></p></blockquote><p>The error is due to the fact that in the <code>USERS</code> table we have created a foreign key that references to the <code>MATCHES</code> table.</p><p>To avoid this error, we are going to indicate that, first of all, all the foreign key restrictions that have been created on the table that we want are deleted erase. To do this, we will add the <code>CASCADE</code> clause to the table drop statement:</p><blockquote><pre><code>DROP TABLE MATCHES CASCADE;</code></pre>< /blockquote><h3>Exercise:</h3><p>Imagine that, in the database, we have the following two tables created:</p><blockquote><pre><code>CREATE TABLE FACULTIES (<br /> COD_FACULTY CHAR(3) PRIMARY KEY,<br /> NAME VARCHAR(100)<br /> );<br /><br />CREATE TABLE MODULES (<br /> CODE INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,<br /> NAME VARCHAR(100),<br /> FACULTY CHAR(3) REFERENCES FACULTIES(COD_FACULTY)<br />);</code></pre></blockquote><p>How would you delete the <code>FACULTIES table </code> without deleting the table <code>MODULES</code>?</p>
